                                        An important thing to be considerate of before traveling to any country is
                                        the weather and temperature. The best time to visit Dubai is during winter
                                        in November to March when the temperature ranges from 30° C to 12° C and the
                                        breeze is cool enough to let you enjoy the sightseeing.

                                    <p> Moreover, the most
                                        awaited Dubai shopping festival is held in December which allows you to buy
                                        anything from any brand throughout the world. The mid-November to early
                                        December and March are the peak seasons to visit the country’s delights and
                                        be a part of the crowds.

                                    </p>

                                    <p><b/>However, visiting Dubai during the months of April-October might serve as
                                        an uninformed decision because the weather is extreme and the air is hot and
                                        humid.</p> <p> The month of February is also not recommended due to

                                    downpours and suffocated weather conditions. Dubai is a hot destination that
                                    should be visited once and the temperature is suitable enough to roam freely
                                    in the country.

                                        people of that country, your packing must be modest and moderate.

                                        weather is unforgiving, and scorching hot, therefore it is highly
                                        recommended to carry sunscreens wherever you go to avoid sunburns and
                                        tanning. Pack light-weight and summer clothes as the overall climate of the
                                        country is not very cool.</p> <p> Although Dubai is a very developed and

                                    country, it is advised not to wear too many revealing clothes in public as
                                    it hurts the sentiments of natives. Being on the safe side is more
                                    preferable and productive.
                                </p> <p> While packing, don’t forget to pack a small medical kit to tackle small
                                    emergencies. Sunglasses, hats, and some desi snacks can also be packed to
                                    cater to your traveling cravings.

                                        is better to exchange money at local shops because they offer better
