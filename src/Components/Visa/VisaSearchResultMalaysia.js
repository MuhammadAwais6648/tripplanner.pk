                                                to Wear and Pack

                                            Malaysia lies around the equator and enjoys tropical weather. Throughout the
                                            year, the wind is humid and hot, shifting to cooler when moving to islands
                                            and mountains. It is recommended to pack clothes made of natural fabrics
                                            that are lightweight and loose-fit. Avoid taking black clothes with you as
                                            they absorb heat and will make you feel warm.

                                            Although Malaysia is not a conservative country, some areas do require you
                                            to cover your hair or wear conventional clothing. Exposing too much bare
                                            skin in public will incur disapproving looks from the public. Also, don’t
                                            forget to carry scarves and long skirts in case you are planning to visit
                                            any shrine or religious place.

                                            One of the most essential things to be considerate of before traveling to
                                            any country is to double-check all the travel documents before departure. Be
                                            sure to keep your passport, identity card, and other necessary documents. Do
                                            browse if the country you are visiting requires certain vaccinations or not
                                            and go through the procedure as mentioned in their travel procedure.

                                            Travelers moving to Malaysia are advised to download the My Sejahtera App
                                            and create a profile there. The purpose of the app is to let you fill out a
                                            departure form from the traveler icon as some airlines won’t allow you to

                                            monsoon rains hit hardest on the eastern side and somewhat cause discomfort
                                            but looking at the brightest side is what makes life interesting. The heavy

                                            breathtaking, soothing, and peaceful.</p> <p>
                                        The monsoon season in Malaysia lasts from November to March and is referred
                                        to as the country’s quiet period because the crowds are less, the weather is
                                        serene, and the view is calming. Grab this win-win situation and enjoy the

                                            The top budget-friendly travel tip for any country is to choose your
                                            residence wisely. Staying in hostels is preferable over hotels or apartments
                                            as it costs less and provides greater exposure. Living with a family or in a
                                            hostel allows you to interact with the locals and understand their culture,
                                            nature, and history more deeply.

                                            Visiting a foreign country demands setting your budget wisely. Private
                                            transport is good and offers leisure and comfort but the facility should be
                                            grabbed only if you have an ample amount of money in your card or wallet.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Most visitors are advised to use local transport for traveling to save money
                                            for other things as well. Moreover, the transport facility in Malaysia is
                                            quite up-to-date and comfortable. Gone are the times when local transport
                                            was proportional to loads of discomfort and irritation.</p> <p>
                                        If you land at Kuala Lumpur airport, you would find many cabs or tuk-tuks
                                        (Malaysian Transport) lined outside to take you to your destination. If not
                                        then you can opt for Express Train or bus running throughout the country and
                                        within the city.

                                        <p>The best time to visit Malaysia depends on the area you plan to visit. The
                                            country’s tropical and equatorial climate faces rain throughout the year,
                                            however, generally the temperature remains hot and humid. The intermittent
                                            rains are not heavy enough to ruin your enjoyment. The country is divided
                                            into two regions: the western and the eastern coast.</p> <p>
                                        The western coast remains dry throughout the year making it best to enjoy
                                        the sea view and beaches. The months of September and October face
                                        comparatively more rain, urging tourists to visit the eastern coast and make
                                        their trips memorable. Both regions face different patterns of rainfall
                                        throughout the year.

                                        <p>David, a Southeast Asian Specialist, once said:<b/>
                                            “With such distinct east and west seasons, the cross-over period between
                                            April and June is a great time to enjoy everything that Malaysia has to
                                            offer.”
